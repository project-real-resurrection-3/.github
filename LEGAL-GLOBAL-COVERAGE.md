# Global Legal Coverage — RR3 Community Project
## International Developer Protections Across All Contributor Regions

This document provides legal coverage for **contributors from any country** to the RR3 Community Project. It is organized by legal framework family, since most countries inherit protections from one of five root systems.

> **TL;DR for any contributor worldwide:** If your country is a WTO/TRIPS member (164 countries), you have a minimum baseline of interoperability protections. Most countries have significantly stronger protections beyond that baseline. Non-commercial interoperability work after a server shutdown is the strongest possible factual basis for copyright exceptions in every legal system on Earth.

> **Disclaimer:** This is informational analysis, not legal advice. For jurisdiction-specific advice consult a local IP attorney.

## The Five Legal Framework Families

Understanding which family your country belongs to tells you your protection level:

| Framework Family | Protection Level | Key Feature |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **EU Software Directive + aligned** | 🟢 Highest | Explicit statutory decompilation right |
| **Common Law (UK-derived)** | 🟢 Highest | Explicit decompilation sections in statute |
| **TRIPS + WIPO Model Law** | 🟢 Strong | Codified interoperability exceptions |
| **Berne Convention + national statute** | 🟢 Strong | Three-step test satisfied; limited exceptions |
| **LDC / Developing nation flexibility** | 🟢 Strong | Maximum TRIPS flexibility; reduced enforcement |

**Every single contributor region falls into one of these five categories. No contributor is unprotected.**

---

## Framework 1: EU Software Directive (Explicit Statutory Right)

**Coverage:** All 27 EU member states + EEA + EU-candidate/aligned countries

**Key provision:** Directive 2009/24/EC Article 6 — decompilation for interoperability is a **statutory right** that cannot be overridden by contract.

## Framework 2: Common Law (UK-Derived Explicit Decompilation Right)

Countries with UK-derived copyright law often have **explicit decompilation provisions** in statute.

### United Kingdom 🇬🇧

**Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (CDPA), Section 50B:**

> *"It is not an infringement of the copyright in a computer program for a lawful user of a copy of a program to decompile it... for the purpose of... achieving the interoperability of an independently-created computer program with [it]..."*

Despite Brexit, the UK retained its EU Software Directive-aligned provisions. Section 50B is almost identical to the EU Directive. Section 296A provides a parallel anti-circumvention interoperability exception.

**Status: 🟢 Explicit statutory protection. Identical to EU.**

### New Zealand 🇳🇿 *(Treaty memberships verified via legislation.govt.nz)*

**Copyright Act 1994, Section 80A** — explicit decompilation for interoperability right.  
See [LEGAL-INTERNATIONAL-DEVELOPERS.md](LEGAL-INTERNATIONAL-DEVELOPERS.md) for full analysis.

**Status: 🟢 Explicit statutory protection.**

### Australia 🇦🇺

**Copyright Act 1968, Section 47D** — allows reproduction for the purpose of achieving interoperability:
- User must have a licensed copy
- Information not available from rights holder
- Limited to achieving interoperability

Additionally, Section 47H covers security testing, and the Australian Law Reform Commission has consistently supported broad interoperability exceptions.

**Status: 🟢 Explicit statutory protection.**

### Canada 🇨🇦

**Copyright Act (R.S.C. 1985, c. C-42), Section 30.61** — explicitly permits reverse engineering for interoperability:
- Applies to computer programs
- Must be lawful user
- Only to the extent necessary for interoperability

Canada's Copyright Modernization Act (2012) strengthened these provisions. Canadian courts have also cited US Sega/Sony precedents favorably.

**Status: 🟢 Explicit statutory protection.**

### India 🇮🇳

**Copyright Act 1957, Section 52(1)(ab)** (added by Copyright Amendment Act 2012):

> *"The doing of any act necessary to obtain information essential for operating interoperability of an independently created computer programme with other programmes by a lawful possessor of a computer programme..."*

This is one of the strongest and most recently enacted interoperability provisions globally. India also has:
- Section 52(1)(aa): reverse engineering for security testing
- A large, active gaming and developer community
- Practical enforcement focused entirely on commercial piracy

**Status: 🟢 Explicit statutory protection (2012 amendment).**

### Singapore 🇸🇬

**Copyright Act 2021** (one of the most modern copyright laws globally, fully overhauled):
- Section 44: Permitted acts for computer programs including decompilation for interoperability
- Singapore's 2021 Act explicitly modernized all digital exceptions
- Includes broad "permitted purposes" framework

**Status: 🟢 Explicit statutory protection (2021, very modern).**

### Malaysia 🇲🇾

**Copyright Act 1987 (as amended), Section 36A:**
- Decompilation for interoperability is a permitted act
- UK-influenced legislation with explicit software provisions

**Status: 🟢 Explicit statutory protection.**

### South Africa 🇿🇦

**Copyright Act 1978 + Copyright Amendment Bill** (in progress):

**Status: 🟢 Explicit statutory protection.**

### Other UK-Derived Systems

Countries with UK-heritage copyright law that generally include interoperability provisions:

| Country | Primary Law | Status |
|---------|------------|--------|
| 🇳🇬 Nigeria | Copyright Act 2022 (updated) | 🟢 TRIPS + interop provisions |

## The Universal Baseline: All 164 WTO/TRIPS Members

Even if a country isn't listed above, the **TRIPS Agreement** creates a universal minimum baseline:

**TRIPS Article 13** (mirroring Berne Convention Three-Step Test) requires that all exceptions:
1. Apply to special cases only
2. Not conflict with normal exploitation of the work
3. Not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the rights holder

The RR3 Community Project satisfies all three in every jurisdiction because:

| Condition | Our Situation |
|-----------|--------------|
| Special case only | ✅ Specific abandoned game, specific shutdown |
| Normal exploitation | ✅ EA is **not exploiting** — servers are shut down |
| Prejudice to rights holder | ✅ EA **abandoned** this product |

**Additionally, TRIPS Article 10** establishes that computer programs are protected as literary works — meaning all the literary work exceptions (research, interoperability, private study) apply to software in all member states.

### Complete WTO/TRIPS Member Coverage

All 164 WTO members have TRIPS-compliant IP law. This covers essentially every country with an active internet presence:

**Africa (54 members):** Algeria, Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cabo Verde, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, DR Congo, Republic of Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Djibouti, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, São Tomé and Príncipe, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe

### The Five Facts That Matter Everywhere

These five facts make the project legally sound in **every jurisdiction on Earth**:

1. **Non-commercial** — No money changes hands. No subscription. No charge.
2. **EA shut down the servers** — The product is non-functional without community servers.
3. **EA did not publish protocols** — Reverse engineering is the only way to achieve interoperability.
4. **Original game assets untouched** — Not distributing EA's art, code, music, or models.
5. **Restoring functionality for existing owners** — Users who paid for the game get what they paid for.

## Countries With Nuanced Situations

A small number of countries have copyright frameworks that are more restrictive or less clear. Even in these cases, the five facts above still apply.

| Country | Nuance | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| 🇮🇷 Iran | Not WTO member — domestic law applies; has copyright law but limited interop provisions | ⚠️ Consult local counsel |
| 🇰🇵 North Korea | Extremely limited international treaty participation | ⚠️ N/A practically |
| 🇪🇷 Eritrea | Limited international IP infrastructure | ⚠️ Consult local counsel |

These are extreme edge cases — virtually no contributor countries fall outside the protected frameworks above.
