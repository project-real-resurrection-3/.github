✅ **Network traffic analysis** (observed API behavior only)

## ❌ What We Don't Do

❌ **Distribute EA's original game client** (users must own RR3)  
❌ **Copy EA source code** (clean-room reverse engineering only)  
❌ **Modify game content** (cars, tracks, assets unchanged)  
❌ **Enable piracy** (users must have legitimate game install)  
❌ **Monetize or profit** (100% non-commercial)  
❌ **Use EA trademarks deceptively** (clear disclaimers everywhere)  
❌ **Harm EA's active business** (EA shut down RR3 servers)
